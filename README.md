# 🏋️‍♂️ **FitFuel Coach – Your Personalized Nutrition & Fitness Tracker**  

## 🔹 **Why I Created FitFuel Coach**  
As an advocate for **health and fitness**, I wanted a tool that would make **tracking macros and hydration easier**.  
Most people (including myself) struggle to **hit daily food and supplement goals**, so I designed FitFuel Coach to:  
✅ **Calculate your daily macros** based on your fitness level, weight, height, and age  
✅ **Encourage hydration** by showing how close you are to your daily water goal  
✅ **Provide AI-powered coaching** to keep you motivated  

## 🔹 **How It Works**  
The app asks you to enter:  
1️⃣ **Your fitness activity level**  
   - Light (1-3 days/week)  
   - Moderate (3-5 days/week)  
   - Very Active (6-7 days/week)  

2️⃣ **Your personal health goals** (e.g., muscle gain, weight loss, maintenance)  

3️⃣ **Your body metrics** – **weight, height, and age** to personalize your macro recommendations  

4️⃣ **Your daily food intake** to track progress  

## 🔹 **FitFuel Coach 1.1 – Upgraded Version**  
In version **1.1**, I added:  
✅ **A food tracker** so you can log daily meals  
✅ **A daily AI coach** to provide **tailored fitness advice** and motivation  
✅ **Progress tracking** so you can see how close you are to **meeting your goals**  

Since everyone’s fitness journey is different, the AI coach **asks what YOU need specifically** rather than giving generic advice.
